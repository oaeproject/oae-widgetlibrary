    <h1>How to develop a widget</h1>
    <p>This section of the Widget SDK is to help you to quickly get started with developing Sakai OAE widgets. Sakai OAE widgets are built using front-end web technologies including HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It's assumed that you have a grasp on these technologies throughout this documentation.</p>
    <p>The best way to get started is with the <%= link_to "Hello World Tutorial", "/sdk/developwidget/learnbasics", :class => "wl-regular-link"%>. It will guide you through <%= link_to "setting up your development environment", "/sdk/developwidget/quickdevsetup", :class => "wl-regular-link"%> if you need to do so.</p>
    <p>After the <%= link_to "Hello World Tutorial", "/sdk/developwidget/learnbasics", :class => "wl-regular-link"%> you may want to check out widget <%= link_to "Coding Standards", "/sdk/developwidget/codingstandards", :class => "wl-regular-link"%>. These cover basic guidelines you should follow when building Sakai OAE widgets for efficient, secure and maintainable code.</p>
