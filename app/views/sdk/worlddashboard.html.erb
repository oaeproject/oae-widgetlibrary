    <p>Dashboard widgets are those that appear on dashboards within Sakai OAE. For example, My Groups, My Profile, My recent contacts and My recent content are all dashboard widgets that appear on a user's personal Home page dashboard:</p>
    <%= image_tag "developer_dashboardwidget_1.jpg", :alt => "World dashboard widget", :class => "descriptive_icon" %>

    <p>Dashboard widgets may also be placed on dashboard pages within a user or group's pages:</p>
    <%= image_tag "developer_dashboardwidget_2.jpg", :alt => "World dashboard widget", :class => "wl-left wl-margin-right-15" %>

    <hr class="wl-hidden wl-push"/>

        <li>optional settings menu accessible through the title bar</li>
        <li>settings view and main view share the same space (the widget contents toggle between the settings and main views):</li>
    </ul>
