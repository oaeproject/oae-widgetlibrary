        <h2 class="wl-regular-link no_decoration wl-normal" id="developmentquestions">Development Questions</h2>
        <h3 id="experience">Q: What kinds of technologies do I need to know to develop Apereo OAE widgets? How much experience will I need?</h3>
        <p>A: Apereo OAE widgets use front-end web technologies such as HTML (for widget layout), CSS (for widget styling), JavaScript (for widget behavior) and JSON (for widget data management). jQuery is a major JavaScript library used throughout Apereo OAE widgets. Apereo OAE has been designed to make widget development very easy and the architecture of a Apereo OAE widget is relatively simple.</p>
        <p>If you are comfortable (but by no means an expert) with HTML, CSS, JavaScript/jQuery and JSON, you should have no problem at all in developing Apereo OAE widgets.</p>
        <p>If you are new to any of the above technologies, you can expect a bit of a ramp up period to get up-to-speed, but because Apereo OAE widgets have a relatively simple architecture, you will be able to quickly learn from other simple widgets within the codebase as examples.</p>
        <p>For example widgets that have been heavily documented in this Widget SDK documentation, see the <%= link_to "Widget designs", "/sdk/designguide/widgetdesigns", :class => "wl-regular-link" %> page.</p>

        <h3 id="installation">Q: How do I get and install Apereo OAE?</h3>
        <p>A: Depending on what you want to do with Apereo OAE, there are different methods for getting and installing Apereo OAE:</p>
        <ul class="inline_list">
            <li>For building, deploying and developing for Apereo OAE on your own machine, follow the instructions on the <%= link_to "quick development setup", "/sdk/developwidget/quicksetup", :class => "wl-regular-link" %> page.</li>
            <li>For simply running and experimenting with the latest Apereo OAE release on your own machine, you can download a one-click installer from the <%= link_to "Apereo OAE release page", "http://www.sakaiproject.org/node/2307", :class => "wl-regular-link" %>. This will not allow you to see or change any of the Apereo OAE code.</li>
            <li>If you have trouble with the one-click installer, you may also download the binary package from the <%= link_to "Apereo OAE release page", "http://www.sakaiproject.org/node/2307", :class => "wl-regular-link" %> and run the server yourself. This option will not allow you to see or change any of the Apereo OAE code.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="documentation">Q: Where do I find detailed documentation on the services that are available for use in my widgets?</h3>
        <p>A: <%= link_to "The Widget API section", "/sdk/api", :class => "wl-regular-link" %> of this documentation contains information on <%= link_to "front-end API", "/sdk/api/frontend", :class => "wl-regular-link" %>, <%= link_to "back-end endpoints", "/sdk/api/backend", :class => "wl-regular-link" %> and <%= link_to "3rd party libraries", "/sdk/api/thirdparty", :class => "wl-regular-link" %> available to Apereo OAE widgets. If you are unable to find information on the service you are looking for, there may be additional locations that would be worthwhile to search:</p>
        <ul class="inline_list">
            <li>All Apereo OAE Widget API functions can be found in the various sakai.api JavaScript files located in the /dev/lib/sakai directory</li>
            <li>For information on services provided directly by the Apereo OAE server, check out these locations:
                <ul class="inline_list">
                    <li><%= link_to "Nakamura Documentation Wiki", "https://confluence.sakaiproject.org/display/KERNDOC/Nakamura+Documentation", :class => "wl-regular-link" %></li>
                    <li>Your local Apereo OAE server's built in documentation: <%= link_to "http://localhost:8080/system/doc", "http://localhost:8080/system/doc", :class => "wl-regular-link" %></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="requirejs">Q: How can I use external JavaScript files and libraries within my widget?</h3>
        <p>A: We use <%= link_to "RequireJS", "http://requirejs.org/", :title => "RequireJS", :class => "wl-regular-link", :target => "_blank" %> to handle loading JavaScript modules and dependencies. You simply add the path to your file at the end of the array of modules. For example, if you want to pull in a JavaScript file from Twitter, you can change this line:  </p>

        <div class="navigationalitems_codesnippit_container few_lines">
<pre class="prettyprint">
require(['jquery', 'sakai/sakai.api.core'], function($, sakai) {
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>Into this:</p>
        <div class="navigationalitems_codesnippit_container few_lines">
<pre class="prettyprint">
require(['jquery', 'sakai/sakai.api.core', 'http://widgets.twimg.com/j/2/widget.js'], function($, sakai) {
</pre>
        </div>

        <h3 id="reportbugs">Q: How do I report a bug?</h3>
        <p>A: Bugs can be reported in <%= link_to "our bug tracking system JIRA", "http://jira.sakaiproject.org", :title => "Apereo OAE bug tracking system JIRA", :class => "wl-regular-link", :target => "_blank" %> by Atlassian.</p>
        <h3 id="suggestfeature">Q: How do I suggest a feature?</h3>
        <p>A: We encourage the community to post and vote ideas on the <%= link_to "Apereo OAE Idea Informer", "http://sakaioae.idea.informer.com/", :title => "Apereo OAE Idea Informer", :class => "wl-regular-link", :target => "_blank" %> page. The Idea Informer is taken into account when setting up goals for the future.</p>
        <h3 id="gitworkflow">Q: What is the best git workflow to use?</h3>
        <p>A: If you're looking for a detailed workflow for setting up your environment, take a look at the <%= link_to "quick development setup", "/sdk/developwidget/quicksetup", :class => "wl-regular-link" %> page.</p>
        <p>There's a few ways of doing the same tasks with GIT, the following list has a few 'best practices' to take into account while developing for the OAE using the GIT version control system.</p>
        <ul class="inline_list">
            <li>Always start work on a new branch based on the master branch (keeps master clean and tidy + allows you to work on multiple widgets at once on different branches);</li>
            <li>Committing and pushing up your work regularly is always a good idea, you don't want to lose precious code and time by having to do it over because your machine failed;</li>
            <li>Use self-explanatory commit messages. OAE developers adopted the following commit message style: "JIRA_ID - DESCRIPTION_OF_WORK". (e.g. "SAKIII-2849 - Implement visual design for top navigation");</li>
            <li>Merge your code with the master branch on a regular basis. If merge conflicts occur you can take care of them immediately instead of having to go through your code again after you've submitted a patch.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you're looking for a guide to the most useful git commands take a look at the '<%= link_to "Git Basics", "/sdk/developwidget/gitbasics", :title => "Git Basics", :class => "wl-regular-link" %>' section.</p>
    </div>

        <h2 id="backgroundinformation" class="wl-regular-link no_decoration wl-normal">Apereo OAE Background information</h2>
        <h3 id="clerelation">Q: How does Apereo OAE relate to Sakai CLE (the previous version of Sakai)?</h3>
        <h3 id="releases">Q: What releases of Apereo OAE are currently available?</h3>
        <h3 id="platforms">Q: What platform(s) does Apereo OAE run on?</h3>
        <h3 id="browsers">Q: What browsers does the OAE support?</h3>
        <p>A: The OAE tries to support as many browsers as possible. However, due to the vast amount of browsers out there we support the 2 latest versions of the most popular browsers.</p>
        <ul class="inline_list">
            <li><%= link_to "Mozilla Firefox", "http://www.mozilla.org/firefox", :title => "Mozilla Firefox", :class => "wl-regular-link", :target => "_blank" %></li>
            <li><%= link_to "Microsoft Internet Explorer", "http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/internet-explorer/products/ie/home", :title => "Microsoft Internet Explorer", :class => "wl-regular-link", :target => "_blank" %></li>
            <li><%= link_to "Google Chrome", "http://www.google.com/chrome/", :title => "Google Chrome", :class => "wl-regular-link", :target => "_blank" %></li>
            <li><%= link_to "Apple Safari", "http://www.apple.com/safari", :title => "Apple Safari", :class => "wl-regular-link", :target => "_blank" %></li>
        </ul>

        <p>For users to fully enjoy your widgets it's best to test them in these browsers before submitting them to the Widget Library.</p>
        <h3 id="license">Q: How is Apereo OAE licensed?</h3>
        <p>A: Apereo OAE is released under the <%= link_to "Educational Community License version 2.0", "http://sakaiproject.org/foundation-licenses", :title => "Educational Community License version 2.0", :class => "wl-regular-link", :target => "blank" %>.</p>
        <h3 id="cost">Q: Do I need to buy or pay anything to create Apereo OAE widgets?</h3>
        <p>A: Developing for Apereo OAE is free and we encourage everyone to participate and create widgets. Take a look at the '<%= link_to "Learn the basics, 'Hello World' tutorial", "/sdk/developwidget/learnbasics", :class => "wl-regular-link" %>' section to get started on your widget.</p>
        <h3 id="experiment">Q: Where can I find working versions of Apereo OAE to experiment with or share with colleagues?</h3>
        <p>A: All latest versions will be announced on the <%= link_to "Apereo OAE release page", "http://sakaiproject.org/oae-release", :title => "Apereo OAE release page", :class => "wl-regular-link", :target => "blank" %>. This page has binaries, web start packages and links to the source code to get you started with the latest version of the Open Academic Environment.</p>
