        <p>The diagrams below detail exactly how to create a dashboard widget, with the correct spacing, font sizes and style and image size use.</p>
        <p>The example used here fits with Featured content, “Featured page, and Featured contacts” but the spacing and font rules also apply to full width dashboard widgets.</p>
        <p>The background style and colour is fixed by the system when you choose your style of widget.</p>
        <p>If you adhere to these rules your widget will fit seamlessly into the dashboard.</p>
